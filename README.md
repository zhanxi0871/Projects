# Projects

## Toxic Comment Classification (Natural Language Processing)                   
•	Applied word embeddings for semantic parsing of 150k comments from Wikipedia’s talk page edits /n
•	Built Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and used Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to classify toxic comments with Python

•	Compared Support Vector Machines with Recurrent Neural Networks, and the latter one is better

•	Achieved the accuracy of 0.97, and helped online discussion become more productive and respectful

## Analysis on Senator Votes for Prediction                              
•	Collected data of 1000 senate roll call votes from Legacy Voteview Website

•	Constructed a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to estimate the senator’s potential party affiliations and attitudes toward bills with different specific themes

•	Conducted collapsed Gibbs sampling and checked the computation efficiency with R

•	Compared clustering performance of LDA model against K-means model, LDA performs better

•	Got accuracy result of 95%, representing that the model is useful for predicting the senator’s future attitudes toward bills with same specific themes 

## Feature Extraction with Linear Discriminant Analysis               
•	Used the large Iris dataset (1500 instances) from UCI Machine Learning Repository

•	Applied linear discriminant analysis to find best features for the Iris picture data set with R

•	Used principal component analysis and null-space linear discriminant analysis to make improvement

•	Got error rate of 0.02, and improved future analysis on Iris data by reducing the number of Iris data needed for processing but keeping all important information 

## Water Scarcity Analysis and Prediction of Western Jilin Province        
•	Attained water, social and environmental situation data from Jilin Bureau of Statistics website

•	Applied system dynamics model to show causal relationships of social and environmental elements

•	Visualized the distribution of water source to analyze the water supply and demand using ArcGIS

•	Used grey forecasting to predict the amount of water resources for the next fifteen years with MATLAB

•	Provide suggestions to improve water ecosystem of Western Jilin based on the analysis and prediction

•	Received Meritorious Winner (First Prize) of Mathematical Contest in Modeling
