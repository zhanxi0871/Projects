# Projects

##Toxic Comment Classification (Natural Language Processing)              Sep. 2018 - Dec. 2018     
•	Applied word embeddings for semantic parsing of 150k comments from Wikipedia’s talk page edits 
•	Built Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and used Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to classify toxic comments with Python
•	Compared Support Vector Machines with Recurrent Neural Networks, and the latter one is better
•	Achieved the accuracy of 0.97, and helped online discussion become more productive and respectful

##Analysis on Senator Votes for Prediction                              Apr. 2018 - Jun. 2018
•	Collected data of 1000 senate roll call votes from Legacy Voteview Website
•	Constructed a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to estimate the senator’s potential party affiliations and attitudes toward bills with different specific themes
•	Conducted collapsed Gibbs sampling and checked the computation efficiency with R
•	Compared clustering performance of LDA model against K-means model, LDA performs better
•	Got accuracy result of 95%, representing that the model is useful for predicting the senator’s future attitudes toward bills with same specific themes
